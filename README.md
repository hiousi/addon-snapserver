This add-on allow you to have a snapcast server and/or client running on Home Assistant to get synchronius audio in multiple rooms.

[Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) is a multiroom client-server audio player developed by [badaix](https://github.com/badaix), where all clients are time synchronized with the server to play perfectly synced audio. It's not a standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing audio player into a Sonos-like multiroom solution.
